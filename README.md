## Difference between AKS & AKS Engine

Every time I talk about AKS and AKS-Engine got the question about the differece between two. It is very simple, AKS is backed up by AKS-Engine, plain and simple. It is the library leveraged by the managed service to perform all the creation, upgrade and node scaling of the cluster. It is used the same way as you would use it manually from your shell. So you can consider AKS-Engine like the upstream of AKS.

## Kubernetes also known as k8s because of the eight letters between K and S.
